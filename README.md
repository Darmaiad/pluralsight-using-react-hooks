# Using React Hooks (Pluralsight)

The project is based on the [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/) course: [Using React Hooks](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/using-react-hooks/table-of-contents) by [Peter Kellner](https://github.com/pkellner)

## Description
This project is simply me taking notes (in the form of code comments) while coding-along the course's instructor. I added my own, stricter, Linter and installed the latest versions of the packages used.

## Note about the Starting Script
The Starting Script will execute two npm scripts. The first one is the  `[next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js)` app container and the second one will start a fake REST server based on `[json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server)`.
